# Horiseon Refractor

## First project

This week our challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means we'll begin with starter code that we need to modify.
This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it
(recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does)
to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 
In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. 
It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google.
It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, our tech lead has given me a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project.
These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
